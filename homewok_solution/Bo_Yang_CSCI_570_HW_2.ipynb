When we have two sorted lists of numbers in non-descending order, and we need to merge them into one sorted list, we can simply compare the first two elements of the lists, extract the smaller one and attach it to the end of the new list, and repeat until one of the two original lists become empty, then we attach the remaining numbers to the end of the new list and it’s done. This takes linear time.

    "You are consulting for a trucking company that does a large amount of business shipping packages between New York and Boston. The volume is high enough that they have to send a number of trucks each day between the two locations. Trucks have a fixed limit $W$ on the maximum amount of weight they are allowed to carry. Boxes arrive at the New York station one by one, and each package $i$ has a weight $w_i$. The trucking station is quite small, so at most one truck can be at the station at any time. Company policy requires that boxes are shipped in the order they arrive; otherwise, a customer might get upset upon seeing a box that arrived after his make it to Boston faster. At the moment, the company is using a simple greedy algorithm for packing: they pack boxes in the order they arrive, and whenever the next box does not fit, they send the truck on its way.\n",
